# Barbase Tools

**Barbase Tools** is a public repository that contains helper scripts, services, and tools used in the development of the [Barbase](https://barbase.solutionary.me) project â€” a service that returns accurate and language-specific product names by barcode.

Barbase uses a community-powered system of voting and verification to ensure the highest quality of product names. Each **barcode** may be associated with multiple **names**, and each **name** can be available in several **languages**. Users vote to select the most accurate name for a barcode and the best translation per language.

## What's in this repository?

This repo serves as a home for utilities and tooling that support the Barbase ecosystem. Planned and existing components include:

- **Language Detection Service** â€” Determines the language of a product name.
- **Camera-Based Recognition Tool** â€” Captures product names using a smartphone or webcam.
- **Parsers and Crawlers** â€” Scripts to extract product data from open websites and convert it into Barbase-compatible format.
- **Import Tools** â€” Scripts and helpers to bulk-import data into the Barbase system.
- **Data Cleaning and Validation Scripts** â€” Ensure imported data meets formatting and quality standards.
